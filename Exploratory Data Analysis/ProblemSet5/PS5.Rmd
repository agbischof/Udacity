# Create a histogram of diamond prices.
# Facet the histogram by diamond color
# and use cut to color the histogram bars.

# The plot should look something like this.

# Note: In the link, a color palette of type
# 'qual' was used to color the histogram using
# scale_fill_brewer(type = 'qual')

# This assignment is not graded and
# will be marked as correct when you submit.

# Create a scatterplot of diamond price vs.

# a diamond's actual volume.

# Many interesting variables are derived from two or more others.
# For example, we might wonder how much of a person's network on
# a service like Facebook the user actively initiated. Two users
# with the same degree (or number of friends) might be very
# different if one initiated most of those connections on the
# service, while the other initiated very few. So it could be
# useful to consider this proportion of existing friendships that
# the user initiated. This might be a good predictor of how active
# a user is compared with their peers, or other traits, such as
# personality (i.e., is this person an extrovert?).

# Your task is to create a new variable called 'prop_initiated'
# in the Pseudo-Facebook data set. The variable should contain
# the proportion of friendships that the user initiated.

# This programming assignment WILL BE automatically graded.

```{r}
pf = read.delim('pseudo_facebook.tsv')
names(pf)
pf$prop_initiated = pf$friendships_initiated/pf$friend_count

ggplot(aes(x = prop_initiated), data = pf) + geom_histogram()
```


# Create a line graph of the proportion of
# friendships initiated ('prop_initiated') vs.
# tenure and color the line segment by
# year_joined.bucket.

# Recall, we created year_joined.bucket in Lesson 5
# by first creating year_joined from the variable tenure.
# Then, we used the cut function on year_joined to create
# four bins or cohorts of users.

# (2004, 2009]
# (2009, 2011]
# (2011, 2012]
# (2012, 2014]

# The plot should look something like this.

# The Gapminder website contains over 500 data sets with information about
# the world's population. Your task is to continue the investigation you did at the
# end of Problem Set 4 or you can start fresh and choose a different
# data set from Gapminder.

# If youâ€™re feeling adventurous or want to try some data munging see if you can
# find a data set or scrape one from the web.

# In your investigation, examine 3 or more variables and create 2-5 plots that make
# use of the techniques from Lesson 5.

# You can find a link to the Gapminder website in the Instructor Notes.

# Once you've completed your investigation, create a post in the discussions that includes:
#       1. the variable(s) you investigated, your observations, and any summary statistics
#       2. snippets of code that created the plots
#       3. links to the images of your plots
